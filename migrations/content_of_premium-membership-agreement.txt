But if we are unsuccessful, you may pursue claims as explained in this section.</p>\n\n	<p>You agree to give us an opportunity to resolve any disputes or claims relating in any way to the Site, any dealings with our customer experience agents, any services or products provided, any representations made by us, or our Privacy Policy (&ldquo;Claims&rdquo;) by contacting us directly. &nbsp;If we are not able to resolve your Claims within 60 days, you may seek relief through arbitration or in small claims court, as set forth below.<br />\n	<br />\n	<strong>Any and all Claims will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court</strong>, except you may assert Claims on an individual basis in small claims court if they qualify. This includes any Claims you assert against us, our subsidiaries, members or any companies offering products or services through us (which are beneficiaries of this arbitration agreement). This also includes any Claims that arose before you accepted these Terms, regardless of whether prior versions of the Terms required arbitration.<br />\n	<br />\n	<strong>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including statutory damages, attorneys&rsquo; fees and costs), and must follow and enforce these Terms of Use as a court would.&nbsp;</strong><br />\n	<br />\n	Arbitrations will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its rules, including the AAA Consumer Rules. Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA&#39;s rules, except as provided in this section. If your total Claims seek less than $10,000, we will reimburse you for filing fees you pay to the AAA and will pay arbitrator&rsquo;s fees. You may choose to have an arbitration conducted by telephone, based on written submissions, or in person in the state where you live or at another mutually agreed location.<br />\n	<br />\n	To begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing your Claims to &ldquo;Skill-Loan Legal: Arbitration Claim Manager,&rdquo; at 43 Bay View Drive, San Carlos, CA 94070.&nbsp; You must also send an electronic copy of the letter by email to the Skill-Loan email address provided to you.&nbsp; If we request arbitration against you, we will give you notice at the email address or street address you have provided. The AAA&#39;s rules and filing instructions are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879.&nbsp;<br />\n	<br />\n	<strong>Any and all proceedings to resolve Claims will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action.&nbsp;</strong>If for any reason a Claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration&nbsp;<strong>we each waive any right to a jury trial</strong>. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement. An arbitration decision may be confirmed by any court with competent jurisdiction.</p>\n\n	<p><strong>20.
